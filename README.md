# BeerTester

A simple tool to produce randomised, multiple-choice tests based on BJCP 2015 guideline data. The test and answer key are output to separate text files. Tests have 20 questions, each with four answer options.

If you run the script with the --studyaid option, it will output a CSV file of the data instead of the test and answer key, which you can use to bone up on your beer stats.

Stats drawn from the data are: ABV, IBU and SRM. This is good to know if you're studying for BCJP certification, or a Beer Sommelier or Cicerone qualification.
